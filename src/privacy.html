          <h1>2 Limes Privacy Policy</h1>
          <h2>Overview</h2>

          <p>
            We strongly support your right to privacy when using our apps.
          </p>

          <p>
            To the extent that our apps can provide their functionality without
            doing so, we prefer to avoid collecting data from you.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the cases where we do collect data, we try to be clear about why
            we're collecting it, and delete it when we no longer need it.
          </p>

          <p>
            We use modern security measures to protect collected data, and limit
            access to only those employees who require access to perform their
            jobs. We may be legally required to disclose collected data to law
            enforcement or government agencies in some situations.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Support Interactions
          </h2>

          <p>
            When handling support requests from you, we collect:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              your email address (or Twitter handle, if you contact us via
              Twitter)
            </li>
            <li>
              any information you provide voluntarily (such as crash logs or
              other diagnostic info)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This information is collected solely to help resolve your support
            inquiry. We retain support emails indefinitely in order to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              have context from previous interactions which may help us answer
              your future questions more quickly
            </li>
            <li>
              identify broad trends in support requests, which may help us
              identify and solve problems with our products
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>
            Application Usage Analytics
          </h2>

          <p>
            Some of our apps may, by default, collect information about the way
            you use them. This data is anonymized before it is sent to us, and
            cannot be used to personally identify you.
          </p>

          <p>
            We look only for broad patterns in the aggregated usage data, such
            as whether or not a particular feature is frequently used, or
            whether users in general prefer one setting over another. This helps
            us make informed decisions about the future development of our apps.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be clear, we do not track individual user behavior in our apps.
            We do not receive information from your device's displays, cameras,
            or microphones.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Crash Logs
          </h2>

          <p>
            By default, if one of our apps crashes while you're using it,
            anonymized data about the crash will be collected to help us
            identify the cause of the crash and hopefully fix it in a future
            update. These "crash logs" contain information such as the state of
            the app, operating system, and device at the time of the crash, but
            not your private data.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your crash log may be sent to a third-party vendor for collection
            and aggregation. Please refer to our list of third-party vendors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Apple may also collect crash logs if the privacy settings of your
            device allow it.
          </p>

          <h2>

            Questions and Feedback
          </h2>

          <p>
            Our privacy policies might change or be edited for clarity over
            time. Up-to-date information will always be available from this
